# Social2Orion
Social2Orion is a REST service (developed in Java) which allows clients (e.g. Social Events Information Providers) to register data about social events (affecting consumption/production in a specific area such as a concert or a football match) into an instance of ORION Context Broker GE.

This component can be eventually re-used and customized to fulfill the general need of having a REST service which is connected to the ORION GE.

A reference implementation of a REST service which is connected to the ORION GE.
